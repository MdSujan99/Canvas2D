#### Bezier
Bezier is a tool that lets you draw curves.
A single curve is drawn when two points representing a line segment along with its two control points are given which determines the curvature of the line segment.
There are 4 parameters required for a curve to be drawn, these are :
1. **Starting Point** : *It is the first point for the line segment.*
2. **Second Point** : *It is the second point for the line segment.*
3. **First Control Point** : *The first half of the line formed between the above two points is pulled towards this point.*
4. **Last Control Point** : *The second half of the line formed between the first two points is pulled towards this point.*
#### p5 Syntax :
```javascript
bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4);
```

## Pencil
Pencil is a freehand tool that lets you draw any arbitrary path or shape of a more complex form without any constraint or parameter.
A single shape starts to be drawn when a user clicks up and until the click is released.

There is no specific parameter that is required for a shape to be drawn using pencil.
#### p5 Syntax :
```javascript
beginShape();
vertex(x1, y1);
...
vertex(xn, yn);
EndShape();
```
