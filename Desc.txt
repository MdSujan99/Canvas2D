## Pencil
Pencil is a freehand tool that lets you draw any arbitrary path or shape of a more complex form without any constraint or parameter.
A single shape starts to be drawn when a user clicks, up until the click is released.

There is no specific parameter that is required for a shape to be drawn using pencil.
